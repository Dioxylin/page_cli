Add a command line into Reddit via Greasemonkey.

Only supports open and help commands right now.

To open pages, do something like `open 3` to open the third item on page, or
`open 4..8` to open the 4th through the 8th pages.

Range for open is 1 to 25, inclusive.

There's also a fairly useless help function.
